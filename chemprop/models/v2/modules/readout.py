        The input `H_v` is a stacked tensor containing the node-level representations for
        `b` separate graphs. I.e., if `H_v` is a tensor of shape `10 x 4` and `sizes` is equal to
        `[3, 4, 3]`, then `H[:3]`,` H[3:7]`, and `H[7:]` correspond to the node-level
        represenataions of the three stacked graphs. The output of this function will then be a
        tensor of shape `3 x 4`

        NOTE: it is possible for a graph to have 0 nodes. In this case, the representation will be
        a zero vector of length `d` in the final output.

        Parameters
        ----------
        H_v : Tensor
            A tensor of shape `sum(sizes) x d` containing the stacked node-level representations of
            `b` graphs
        sizes : Iterable[int]
            an iterable of length `b` containing the number of nodes in each of the `b` graphs,
            respectively. NOTE: `sum(sizes)` must be equal to `len(H_v)`

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor
            a tensor of shape `b x d` containing the graph-level representations of each graph

        Raises
        ------
