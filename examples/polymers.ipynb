    "From a chemical perspective the formation and use of polymers is relatively straightforward. However, their computational representation is challenging and often fails to capture all aspects of the polymer. One way to represent polymers involves using weighted directed graphs, which include stoichiometry, polymer types and the direction and weight of the bonds. This example notebook will go through the weighted directed graph representation of polymers and how they can be used to model polymers in Chemprop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative polymer representations rely on repetitive monomer representations to depict a complete polymer chain, which is both inefficient and unrealistic. Basic graph datasets can represent a single repeating unit of one or more monomers To account for the repeating patterns of different monomers at various open bonds, weights and directions can be assigned to different connection sites. Therefore, by incorporating weights and directions into a basic graph, we can efficiently manage the repeating architecture of polymers. \n",

    "The basic unit of a polymer is the monomer. Large numbers of repeating monomers form a polymer chain. Polymers can sometimes be composed of various types of monomers in different proportions, also known as co-polymers.

Weights can be assigned at two levels: to the individual monomer atoms and to each bond. While the direction is generally consistent across different monomers, there in an edge case where a bond refers to itself (also known as a self-loop or self-edge in graphs), where an open bond connects with the same open bond of another monomer with an identical structure.
