Welcome to Chemprop's documentation!
====================================

This website contains documentation for Chemprop, a PyTorch-based framework for training and evaluating message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) for molecular property prediction. The pacakge was originally developed for :footcite:t:`yang_analyzing_2019` and further described in :footcite:t:`heid_chemprop_2023`.

To get started with Chemprop, check out the :ref:`quickstart` page, and for more detailed information, see the :ref:`installation` and :ref:`tutorial` pages.

If you use Chemprop to train or develop a model in your own work, we would appreciate if you cite the following papers:
