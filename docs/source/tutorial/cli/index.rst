Command Line Tutorials
======================

.. note::
    Chemprop recently underwent a ground-up rewrite and new major release (v2.0.0). A helpful transition guide from Chemprop v1 to v2 can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vRshySIknVBBsTs5P18jL4WeqisxDAnDE5VRnzxqYEhYrMe4GLS17w5KeKPw9sged6TmmPZ4eEZSTIy/pubhtml>`_. This includes a side-by-side comparison of CLI argument options, a list of which arguments will be implemented in later versions of v2, and a list of changes to default hyperparameters.

Chemprop may be invoked from the command line using the following command:

.. code-block::

    $ chemprop COMMAND [ARGS]

where ``COMMAND`` is one of the following:

* ``train``: Train a model.
* ``predict``: Make predictions with a trained model.
* ``convert``: Convert a trained Chemprop model from v1 to v2.
* ``hpopt``: Perform hyperparameter optimization.
* ``fingerprint``: Use a trained model to compute a learned representation.

and ``ARGS`` are command-specific arguments. To see the arguments for a specific command, run:

.. code-block::

    $ chemprop COMMAND --help

For example, to see the arguments for the ``train`` command, run:

.. code-block::

    $ chemprop train --help

To enable logging, specify ``--log <path/to/logfile>`` or ``--logfile <path/to/logfile>``, where ``<path/to/logfile>`` is the desired path to which the logfile should be written; if unspecified, the log will be written to ``chemprop_logs``.
The default logging level is INFO. If more detailed debugging information is required, specify ``-v`` for DEBUG level. To decrease verbosity below the default INFO level, use ``-q`` for WARNING or ``-qq`` for ERROR.

Chemprop is built on top of Lightning, which has support for training and predicting on GPUs.
Relevant CLI flags include `--accelerator` and `--devices`.
See the `Lightning documentation <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/accelerators/gpu_basic.html#choosing-gpu-devices>`_ and CLI reference for more details.

For more details on each command, see the corresponding section below:

* :ref:`train`
* :ref:`predict`
* :ref:`convert`
* :ref:`hpopt`
* :ref:`fingerprint`

The following features are not yet implemented, but will be included in a future release:

* ``interpret``: Interpret model predictions.
