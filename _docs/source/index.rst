Chemprop
========

`Chemprop <https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop>`_ is a message passing neural network for molecular property prediction.

At its core, Chemprop contains a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN), which was first presented in `Analyzing Learned Molecular Representations for Property Prediction <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00237>`_. The Chemprop D-MPNN shows strong molecular property prediction capabilities across a range of properties, from quantum mechanical energy to human toxicity.

Chemprop was later used in the paper `A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery <https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30102-1>`_ to discover promising new antibiotics by predicting the likelihood that a molecule would inhibit the growth of *E. coli*.
